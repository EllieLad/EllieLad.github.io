  <h2>Me me me! </h2>
  <p>My name is Ellie McCormick and I'm an UI/UX & graphic designer based in Canada. I spent time studying and working in Manchester UK, where I lived for 10 years, I then recently uprooted everything to move to Canada!
I specialise in web design and mobile applications. I also freelance as a graphic designer. I am excited by all things design, I am passionate about crafting ideas with meaning and emotion.
</p>
<p>
I have 4 years experience working in a fast paced collaborative environment with brands such as the LADbible Group, one of the biggest publishers in the UK. Working to develop digital concepts and solve problems together. I understand the full UX lifecycle from research to design and I am not afraid to put pencil to paper.
